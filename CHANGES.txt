 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.8.4 that includes minor improvements:
    - Updated streaming architecture implementation to apply feature flag updates from the notification received which is now enhanced, improving efficiency and reliability of the whole update system.

10.22.6 (July 6, 2023)
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.8.3 that includes the following bug fix:
    - Bugfix - The `destroy` method has been updated to immediately flag the SDK client as destroyed, to prevent access to the storage when `getTreatment` and `track` methods are called after the SDK is destroyed.

10.22.5 (May 15, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.8.2 that includes minor improvements.
    - Updated terminology on the SDKs codebase to be more aligned with current standard without causing a breaking change. The core change is the term split for feature flag on things like logs and IntelliSense comments.
    - Updated split storage modules to optimize some operations when using Redis and pluggable storages.
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

10.22.4 (March 9, 2023)

 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

10.22.3 (December 16, 2022)
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Bugfixing - Upgrade @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.7.3 which includes a memory leak fix for localhost mode (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-commons/issues/181) among other improvements.

10.22.2 (November 3, 2022)
 - Bugfixing - Replaced bloom filter dependency that caused dependency conflicts (with farmhash lib) in AWS Lambda. This change only affects Node flavor.

10.22.1 (October 14, 2022)
 - Bugfixing - Upgrade @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.7.2, that handles `Navigator.sendBeacon` API exceptions in the browser, and fallback to regular Fetch/XHR transport in case of error.

10.22.0 (October 5, 2022)
 - Added a new impressions mode for the SDK called NONE, to be used in factory when there is no desire to capture impressions on an SDK factory to feed Split's analytics engine. Running NONE mode, the SDK will only capture unique keys evaluated for a particular feature flag instead of full blown impressions.
 - Updated default value of `scheduler.featuresRefreshRate` config parameter from 5 seconds to 60 seconds for NodeJS and from 30 seconds to 60 seconds for Browser.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.7.1, that improves the performance of feature flag evaluations (i.e., `getTreatment(s)` method calls) when using the default storage in memory, among other improvements.

10.21.1 (July 25, 2022)
 - Bugfixing - Added missed type definitions `enabled` from `sync`.

10.21.0 (July 22, 2022)
 - Added `autoRequire` configuration option to the Google Analytics to Split integration, which takes care of requiring the splitTracker plugin on trackers dynamically created by Google tag managers (See https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040838752#set-up-with-gtm-and-gtag.js).
 - Updated browser listener to push remaining impressions and events on 'visibilitychange' and 'pagehide' DOM events, instead of 'unload', which is not reliable in modern mobile and desktop Web browsers.
 - Updated the synchronization flow to be more reliable in the event of an edge case generating delay in cache purge propagation, keeping the SDK cache properly synced.
 - Updated some dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Bugfixing - Moved js-yaml dependency from @splitsoftware/splitio-commons to avoid resolution to an incompatible version on certain npm versions when installing third-party dependencies that also define js-yaml as transitive dependency (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/issues/662).

10.20.0 (June 29, 2022)
 - Added a new config option to control the tasks that listen or poll for updates on feature flags and segments, via the new config sync.enabled . Running online Split will always pull the most recent updates upon initialization, this only affects updates fetching on a running instance. Useful when a consistent session experience is a must or to save resources when updates are not being used.
 - Updated telemetry logic to track the anonymous config for user consent flag set to declined or unknown.
 - Updated submitters logic, to avoid duplicating the post of impressions to Split cloud when the SDK is destroyed while its periodic post of impressions is running.

10.19.1 (Jun 13, 2022)
 - Updated eventsource dependency range to ^1.1.2 to avoid a vulnerability and dependency resolution to a vulnerable version of url-parse transitive dependency.
 - Bugfixing - Updated submitters logic, to avoid dropping impressions and events that are being tracked while POST request is pending.

10.19.0 (May 24, 2022)

 - Updated SDK telemetry storage, metrics and updater to be more effective and send less often.
 - Bugfixing - Updated default values for `scheduler.impressionsRefreshRate` config parameter: 300s for OPTIMIZED impression mode and 60s for DEBUG impression mode,
   in both Browser and NodeJS (previously it was 60s and 300s in Browser and NodeJS respectively, equal for DEBUG and OPTIMIZED impression modes).

10.18.2 (May 6, 2022)
 - Bugfixing - Removed "ip" dependency to use an inline copy of it that fixes an error when using it in Node v18 (https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/issues/113).

10.18.1 (April 20, 2022)
 - Updated some dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Bugfixing - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to avoid an error when requiring some third-party dependencies used by the package (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/issues/662).
 - Bugfixing - Updated `ready` method to rejects the promise with an Error object instead of a string value (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/issues/654).

10.18.0 (April 7, 2022)
 - Added user consent feature to allow delaying or disabling the data tracking from SDK until user consent is explicitly granted or declined. Read more in our docs.
 - Added `scheduler.impressionsQueueSize` property to SDK configuration to limit the amount of impressions tracked in memory. Read more in our docs.
 - Added support to accept TLS configuration options to the Redis storage in NodeJS. Read more in our docs.
 - Updated type definitions to specialize the type of the `storage.options` object for Redis storage in NodeJS.
 - Updated some dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
 - Bugfixing - Updated internal isObject utility function, to avoid unexpected behaviors on frameworks and libraries that uses multiple VM contexts, like NuxtJS dev server.
 - Bugfixing - Logging settings (i.e., the `debug` SDK configuration param and factory logger methods) are configurable per factory instance, instead of affecting all factories globally.
 - Bugfixing - Fixed an issue with `connectionTimeout` options params of Redis storage, that was being ignored and not passed down to the underlying ioredis client.
 - Bugfixing - Updated the validation of some SDK configuration params to log errors and throw exceptions with clear descriptions of the invalid setup:
    - If passing a non-string value to `sync.impressionsMode`, the SDK logs the error: "you passed an invalid impressionsMode config param. It should be one of the following values: 'OPTIMIZED', 'DEBUG'. Defaulting to 'OPTIMIZED'.".
    - If passing 'REDIS' storage type without setting `mode` to 'consumer', the SDK logs the error: "The provided REDIS storage is invalid for this mode. It requires 'consumer' mode. Fallbacking into default MEMORY storage.".
    - If passing 'consumer' mode without setting `storage.type` to 'REDIS', the SDK throws an exception with message: "A REDIS storage is required on consumer mode.".

 - NOTABLE CHANGE: since version 10.18.0, the SDK has been refactored to use @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package in order to reuse core modules shared across all JavaScript-based SDKs. Most internal modules have been moved and renamed,
  but it does not imply a breaking change as long as the library is imported via its main entrypoint (e.g., `const { SplitFactory } = require('@splitsoftware/splitio')` or `import { SplitFactory } from '@splitsoftware/splitio'`).

10.17.3 (February 25, 2022)
 - Updated format for MySegments keys in LocalStorage, keeping backwards compatibility (issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/issues/638).

10.16.1 (October 25, 2021)
 - Updated some internal modules to optimize the time efficiency of feature flag evaluations (i.e., `getTreatment(s)` method calls).
 - Updated some dependencies for vulnerability fixes (ioredis, @babel/cli, eslint, eslint-plugin-compat).
 - Bugfixing - Fixed localhost mode with localStorage, to use a mock in memory instead of localStorage API directly but keep emitting emit SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event.

10.16.0 (September 28, 2021)
 - Updated localhost mode to emit SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event in Browser when using localStorage (issue https://github.com/splitio/react-client/issues/34).
 - Updated streaming logic to use the newest version of our streaming service, including:
      - Integration with Auth service V2, connecting to the new channels and applying the received connection delay.
      - Implemented handling of the new MySegmentsV2 notification types (SegmentRemoval, KeyList, Bounded and Unbounded)
      - New control notification for environment scoped streaming reset.
 - Updated some dependencies to their latest versions, including Webpack 4 to 5, to build a more optimized UMD bundle.
 - NOTE: build script is configured to transpile to ES5 with Babel loose mode (https://2ality.com/2015/12/babel6-loose-mode.html). It results in a smaller bundle size and faster code execution but with some differences in the transpiled code, that may affect old browser versions like some builds of IE10.

10.15.7 (June 3, 2021)
 - Updated some dependencies with vulnerability fixes.
 - Removed "utfx" dependency to use an inline copy of it with the minimum features used by the SDK (issue #544).
 - Bugfixing - Fixed some issues of localhost mode:
      - Support localhost mode on multiple SDK instances. Each instance handles its own mocked features, instead of sharing the same mock.
      - SDK_UPDATE is emitted only once if mocked features changes.
      - On shared clients, SDK_UPDATE event is now emitted if mocked features changes.

10.15.6 (May 21, 2021)
 - Updated error handling following the recommended practice of throwing only Error objects.
 - Updated ioredis version now that their incompatibility with Node <10 was already fixed.

10.15.2 (Dec 3, 2020)
 - Updated requests for `/testImpressions/beacon` to include the impressions mode.

10.15.1 (Nov 12, 2020)
 - Updated the version for ioredis in the package.json to be fixed to 4.18.0 given after 4.19.0 it requires Node 10, in case this SDK is installed without considering our package-lock.json file on an old Node.
 - Updated TypeScript declarations to include the `urls` settings object (to connect to Split Synchronizer in proxy mode) for the non-async settings where it would be applicable.
 - Bugfixing - Updating some imports of hashing utilities to use safe relative paths and avoid module resolution issues.
 - Bugfixing - Updating logic to avoid a corner case issue with the sendHitTask callback handling of the GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TO_SPLIT integration.
 - Bugfixing - Updating the package.json version import to be compatible with latest standards (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/pull/495, thanks @andrew-t-james-hm).

10.15.0 (Oct 6, 2020)
 - Added impressions dedupe logic to avoid sending duplicated impressions:
    - Added `ImpressionsCount` cache to count impressions generated per feature.

    - Added new endpoint (`testImpressions/count`) to send all the generated impressions in a time frame.
    - Added beacon endpoint for ImpressionsCount.
    - Added murmur3 128 bits hashing and splitted logic between browser and node.
    - Added `OPTIMIZED` and `DEBUG` modes in order to enabling/disabling how impressions are going to be sent into Split servers,
        - `OPTIMIZED`: will send unique impressions in a timeframe in order to reduce how many times impressions are posted to Split.
        - `DEBUG`: will send every impression generated to Split.
 - Updated JSON bulk properties for Impressions to decrease the payload size.
 - Updated `ImpressionsTracker` and `ImpressionTracker` to be only one and be used for both type of evaluations: `getTreatment` and `getTreatments`.
 - Bugfixing - added URI encoding of user keys to avoid HTTP errors when fetching MySegments for keys with special characters.

10.14.2 (Sep 18, 2020)
 - Updated `node-fetch` dependency to fix a vulnerability.
 - Bugfixing - updated the feature detection of Set global constructor to avoid possible reference errors.

10.14.1 (Aug 13, 2020)
 - Updated push streaming support for Node to optimize requests to Split services.

 - Removed axios HTTP library in favor of fetch for browsers (with XHR as fallback) and node-fetch for Node JS.

10.12.0 (April 30, 2020)
 - Added support for the new Split streaming architecture. When enabled, the SDK will not poll for updates but instead receive notifications every time there's a change in your environments,
  allowing to process those much quicker. If disabled (default) or in the event of an issue, the SDK will fallback to the known polling mechanism to provide a seamless experience.

10.11.1 (Mar 19, 2020)
 - Updated @babel/runtime-corejs3, @types/node and several dev dependencies.
 - Updated the name of the "events" config of GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TO_SPLIT integration to "hits".

 - Added SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event, which will be emitted in LocalStorage mode when the SDK finds feature flag definitions in the storage of the browser.
 - Updated a dependency to fix a vulnerability (serialize-javascript).
 - Updated multiple dependencies and dev dependencies (@types/node, axios, core-js, events, sinon, tape and the babel cli, core, preset-env, register and plugin-transform-runtime)

10.9.2 (Nov 20, 2019)

   - startup.retriesOnFailureBeforeReady default value went up from 1.5s to 5s.
 - Updated trafficType from manager to 'localhost' when the SDK is running in localhost mode.
 - Updated polling logic to stop and restart mySegments data synchronization (on browsers) when not currently used on Splits.

10.8.2 (Jul 26, 2019)
 - Added `/src` folder to the npm package distribution for users that needs to transpile the package themselves.
 - Bugfixing - Incorrect warnings caused by TrafficType storage counter when a Split is updated for inMemory and LocalStorage mode.
 - Updated three dev dependencies to remove vulnerability warnings when running npm audit (lodash, set-value, mixin-deep).

10.8.1 (May 31, 2019)

 - Added Dynamic Configurations support through two new methods that mimick the regular ones, changing the type of what is returned.
   - getTreatmentWithConfig: Same as getTreatment, but instead of a string it returns a map with treatment and config as a stringified JSON.
   - getTreatmentWithConfig: Same as getTreatments, but instead of a map of string it returns a map of objects with treatment and config as a stringified JSON.
 - Added configs to SplitViews returned by the manager module.
 - Updated localhost mode. Now besides supporting the old text files with `.split` extension (to be deprecated soon), we support YAML (.yaml/.yml) files where you can
  define configurations for your treatments and also whitelisted keys. Read more in our docs!
 - Updated manager method to avoid creating more than one instance.
 - Updated how we handle timeout per request, setting startup.requestTimeoutBeforeReady to less than 1 applies no timeout per request.

10.6.1 (Mar 15, 2019)
 - Updated default value for scheduler.featuresRefreshRate on NodeJS. New default is 5 seconds.

10.6.0 (Feb 12, 2019)
 - BREAKING CHANGE: Updated impressions cache for Redis storage to reduce the amount of Redis operations by using a single queue (Must use Synchronizer 2.x or above with this or newer SDK versions).
 - Added stricter validations to the input of the SDK api to provide better and faster feedback in case of missuse. We want our users to be able to diagnose issues sooner,
  instead of when you can't find the data you're looking for. As part of this, some error logs (just logs) will be visible even with the SDK Logger disabled.
 - Updated getTreatments to have it's own latency metric for the whole operation, instead of one per each feature evaluation.
 - Updated default values on configuration for NodeJS.
   - startup.readyTimeout default value went up from 0s (no timeout limit) to 15s.

10.5.1 (Dec 20, 2018)
 - Bugfixing - Fixing an issue where a Split with Traffic Allocation set to one would return the default treatment for 100% of the traffic (instead of 99%).

10.5.0 (Nov 7, 2018)
 - Added custom impression listener feature, so customers can receive all the impressions data on a callback to handle as they place.
  Completely optional, the only requirement is that the element being set as impression listener should have a method called `logImpression`
  where they'll receive all the data. Read more in our docs!
 - Added Redis support for track events. Now if you're running the `split-synchronizer` and the Node SDK on `consumer mode`, your track events
  will go to Redis and be sent to Split by the synchronizer.
 - Added a wrapper on top of ioredis to better handle operations and reduce unwanted library effects.
 - Removed unnecessary keys/scans on Redis.
 - Bugfixing - Calling factory.client on the browser with the same key used on configuration created a new unnecessary instance.

    with 'on', 'enable' or 'enabled'.

  2. By passing an extra setting when instantiating the SDK.

    ```js
    var splitio = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');

    var settings = {
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
        key: 'CUSTOMER_KEY'  // If on the browser.
      },
      debug: true  // Boolean flag for enabling logs. Default value is false.
    };

    var sdk = splitio(settings);
    ```

  3. By calling the SDK Logger API (no need for browser refresh):

    ```js
    var splitio = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');

    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
        key: 'CUSTOMER_KEY'  // If on the browser.
      }
    });

    // Logger API.
    sdk.Logger.enable();
    sdk.Logger.disable();
    ```

 - Added Time Tracker logs. When logs are enabled, we log how much time takes to complete
  SDK important tasks, like getting ready, downloading important information or pushing
  metrics and impressions to Split.
 - Bugfixing - Return correct label when consulted Split is not found.

9.1.1 (May 03, 2017)
 - Bugfixing - Fixed invalid behaviour when using native Fetch API and comparing statusText
  instead of resp.ok

9.1.0 (April 21, 2017)
 - Adding support for STRING matchers.
 - client.destroy() will disconnect from Redis instance, if you are using that storage.
 - Improved support for multiple SDK instances working at the same time.
 - Improved attribute values type coercion.
 - No API changes.

9.0.0 (April 17, 2017)
 - Adding support for SET matchers.
 - Added some type coercion for attribute values, in case we don't receive a value of the expected type.
 - No API changes.

8.2.0 (April 12, 2017)
 - Adding traffic allocation support.
 - Adding support for murmur hashing algorithm.
 - Adding getTreatments method to client API. For example:

```js
var treatmentsMap = client.getTreatments('CUSTOMER_KEY', ['Feature_flag_1', 'Feature_flag_2']);

/*
* treatmentsMap will be an object mapping feature flags with treatments. For example:
* {
*   Feature_flag_1: 'on',
*   Feature_flag_2: 'off
* }
*/
```

 - Bugfixing on manager API for localhost.

8.1.3 (April 11, 2017)
 - No API changes. Bug fixing release.

8.1.2 (April 6, 2017)
 - Bug fixing release to improve startup performance.

8.1.1 (March 31, 2017)
 - Small fix on declaration files.

8.1.0 (March 30, 2017)
 - No API changes.
 - Added typescript support. SplitSDK custom types live on the SplitIO namespace.

  For example:

  ```ts
  const myTreatment: SplitIO.Treatment;
  const myBrowserSettings: SplitIO.IBrowserSettings;
  ```

8.0.0 (March 10, 2017)
 - New API to improve development experience. We added a migration layer so you
  could use the new version of the SDK and make the migration when you have
  time.

  In the browser we only need:

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-7.4.0.min.js"></script>
  ```

  Change by:

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-migration-8.0.0.min.js"></script>
  ```

  In NodeJS or CommonJS environments:

  ```js
  var sdk = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');
  ```

  Change with:

  ```js
  var sdk = require('@splitsoftware/splitio/migration');
  ```

 - NodeJS now added support for Redis to keep consistency across multiple SDK
  instances.

  We have added a new setting parameter to control which storage use, and how
  the SDK works internally:

  ```js
  const SplitFactory = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');
  const config = {
    mode: 'consumer',
    core: {
      authorizationKey: '<your-api-token>'
    },
    storage: {
      type: 'REDIS',
      options: {
        url: 'redis://<your-redis-server>:<your-redis-server-port>/0'
      },
      prefix: 'nodejs' // Optional prefix to prevent any kind of data collision between SDK versions.
    }
  };

  const client = SplitFactory(config);

  // Redis in NodeJS is async so we can use async/await syntax
  const treatment = await client.getTreatment('my-feature-comming-from-localstorage');

  // or just use the returned promise
  client.getTreatment('my-feature-comming-from-localstorage').then(treatment => {
    // do something with the treatment
  });
  ```

 - Added Manager API to query the state of the SDK. Please check the official
  documentation for details.

 - In Browser land, we can now enable localStorage as backend so we can reload
  the SDK quickly without downloading all the data again.

  This should improve the ready event significantly when you have a good amount
  of Splits in your setup.

  ```js
  const config = {
    core: {
      authorizationKey: '<your-api-token>',
      key: '<user-key>'
    },
    storage: {
      type: 'LOCALSTORAGE'
    }
  };

  const factory = splitio(config);
  const client = factory.client();

  const treatment = client.getTreatment('my-feature-comming-from-localstorage');
  ```

 - Added support for offline changes release to improve development experience,
  specially in NodeJS where we used to have a server running and spin it up each
  time we change a treatment is a headache.

  ```js
  const config = {
    core: {
      authorizationKey: '<your-api-token>',
      key: '<user-key>'
    },
    scheduler: {
      offlineRefreshRate: 15 // update internal SDK state each 15 sec
    },
    features: {
      mySplit: 'on'
    }
  };

  const factory = splitio(config);
  const client = factory.client();

  await client.ready();

  client.getTreatment('my_feature') === 'on'; // true

  factory.settings.features.my_feature = 'off'; // Apply this cache programatically

  client.getTreatment('my_feature') === 'off'; // Some time after you will be able to verify this
  ```

7.4.0 (January 23, 2017)
 - None API changes. Bug fixing release.

7.3.0 (January 19, 2017)
 - Small addition to SDK configurations so you can inject bucketing key and labels.

7.1.1 (November 16, 2016)
 - None API changes. Bug fixing release.

7.1.0 (November 15, 2016)
 - None API changes. Bug fixing release.

7.0.1 (September 16, 2016)
 - Huge project refactoring, specially focus on simplicity. We have replaced the
  library building system to get more power while we generate the release.
 - Improved documentation.

6.0.1 (June 24, 2016)
 - Critical bug fixed which prevent ready state of the SDK.

6.0.0 (June 24, 2016)
 - In the browser land we allow quick retries before start using the refresh
  rates defined for segments and feature flags, plus the possibility of receive an
  event when the SDK is taking to much time to startup.

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-6.0.0.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
        key: 'myuser@domain.com'
      },
      startup: {
        // timeout an *initial* request after 0.8 seconds (only affects startup)
        requestTimeoutBeforeReady: 0.8,
        // how many quick retries are allowed before use the schedulers refresh
        // rates (only affects startup)
        retriesOnFailureBeforeReady: 1,
        // maximum amount of seconds we are going to wait for the ready event
        readyTimeout: 1.5
      }
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT, function () {
      // this callback will be called after 1.5 seconds if and only if the SDK
      // is not ready for that time
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_READY, function () {
      // the SDK is ready for start making evaluations with your data
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_UPDATE, function () {
      // fired each time the SDK state change
    });
  </script>
  ```

5.1.1 (June 13, 2016)
 - None API changes. Bug fixing release.

5.1.0 (June 9, 2016)
 - Bug fixing release.

5.0.0 (June 6, 2016)
 - Added support for multiple instances.

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-5.0.0.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    // instanciation
    var dynamic1 = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
        key: 'myuser@domain.com'
      }
    });

    var dynamic2 = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
        key: 'annoy@domain.com'
      }
    });

    // usage
    var t1 = dynamic1.getTreatment('feature-flag-name');
    var t2 = dynamic2.getTreatment('another-feature-flag-name');

    // stop SDK
    dynamic1.destroy();
    dynamic2.destroy();

    // unreference
    dynamic1 = null;
    dynamic2 = null;
  </script>
  ```

 - SDK instances inherit from EventEmitter.

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-5.0.0.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
        key: 'myuser@domain.com'
      }
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_READY, function sdkReadyEvent() {
      // This event will be fired once
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_UPDATE, function sdkUpdateEvent() {
      // This event will be fired each time the SDK downloads an update
    });
  </script>
  ```

4.0.0 (April 13, 2016)
 - No more url changes required to switch to development mode.

  - Before (3.0.0 or earlier)
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.split.io/sdk/offline-3.0.0.js"></script>
  <script>
    var sdk = splitio({
      features: {
        feature_name_1: 'treatment_value_1',
        feature_name_2: 'treatment_value_2',
        ...
      }
    });
  </script>
  ```

  - After (4+)
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.split.io/sdk/split-4.0.0.js"></script>
  <script>
    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'localhost'
      },
      features: {
        feature_name_1: 'treatment_value_1',
        feature_name_2: 'treatment_value_2',
        ...
      }
    });
  </script>
  ```

  Now you can forget the switch between urls, everything is bundled into the same
  package!

3.0.0 (April 10, 2016)
 - Added support for attributes.

```js
var sdk = splitio({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'c1l5vkd50gimccout3c03pntbu', // your SDK key
    key: '4a2c4490-ced1-11e5-9b97-d8a25e8b1578'     // your customer id
  }
});

var treatment = sdk.getTreatment('my_feature', {
  age: 24,
  likes: ['apple', 'orange'],
  dob: new Date('1991-05-22').getTime()
});
```

 - Minor bug fixes and code clean up.

2.1.0 (March 29, 2016)
 - Added better handling of possible error situations when:

  1. If there is none defaultTreatment present, use 'control' treatment.
  2. Unexpected matcher structures should produce a 'control' treatment.

2.0.0 (March 21, 2016)
 - Breaking Changes

  - If you are using custom refresh rates, please change them from milliseconds to
seconds:

```js
var sdk = splitio({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'c1l5vkd50gimccout3c03pntbu', // your SDK key
    key: '4a2c4490-ced1-11e5-9b97-d8a25e8b1578'     // your customer id
  },
  scheduler: {
    featuresRefreshRate:    60, // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 60000 milliseconds
    segmentsRefreshRate:    60, // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 60000 milliseconds
    metricsRefreshRate:     30, // in 2.x 30 sec, in 1.x 30000 milliseconds
    impressionsRefreshRate: 30  // in 2.x 30 sec, in 1.x 30000 milliseconds
  }
});
```

 - New features

 - Based on users feedback, the new recommended values for all the refresh rates are:

```js
scheduler: {
  featuresRefreshRate:    30, // in 2.x 30 sec, in 1.x 60000 milliseconds (1min)
  segmentsRefreshRate:    60, // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 60000 milliseconds (1min)
  metricsRefreshRate:     60, // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 300000 milliseconds (5min)
  impressionsRefreshRate: 60  // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 300000 milliseconds (5min)
}
```

1.0.1 (March 16, 2016)
 - Make it public in npm

1.0.0 (March 15, 2016)
 - Initial public release
