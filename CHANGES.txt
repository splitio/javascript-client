10.12.2 (Jun XX, 2020)
 - Updated client.ready() function to be consumed on demand and return a promise reflecting the current status of the SDK at the time the method was invoked.
 - Updated readiness events on consumer mode: the SDK emits SDK_READY event once the connection to Redis cache is successful.

10.12.1 (May 18, 2020)
 - Updated logging messages for streaming notifications to DEBUG log level.
 - Updated asynchronous logic handling to avoid async/await syntax in order to remove regenerator-runtime dependency.
 - Removed axios HTTP library in favor of fetch for browsers (with XHR as fallback) and node-fetch for Node JS.

10.12.0 (April 30, 2020)
 - Added support for the new Split streaming architecture. When enabled, the SDK will not poll for updates but instead receive notifications every time there's a change in your environments,
  allowing to process those much quicker. If disabled (default) or in the event of an issue, the SDK will fallback to the known polling mechanism to provide a seamless experience.

10.11.1 (Mar 19, 2020)
 - Updated @babel/runtime-corejs3, @types/node and several dev dependencies.
 - Updated the name of the "events" config of GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TO_SPLIT integration to "hits".

10.11.0 (Mar 13, 2020)
 - Added integrations property to configuration which could receive a list of valid integrations.
 - Added support of inbound and outbound SDK to SDK integrations for Google Analytics. Read more in our documentation's integrations section.
 - Updated logging logic to avoid calling console.error in the client side.
 - Updated logging error messages priority to significantly reduce the amount of error level logs that can't be silenced.
 - Updated axios to 0.19.2 and few other minor updates on dev dependencies.
 - Updated default metricsRefreshRate from 60s to 120s and reduced the log level from ERROR to INFO for telemetry post failures.
 - Bugfixing - Emit SDK_UPDATE in localhost only when mock was actually updated.

10.10.0 (Jan 10, 2020)
 - Added SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event, which will be emitted in LocalStorage mode when the SDK finds split cache in the storage of the browser.
 - Updated a dependency to fix a vulnerability (serialize-javascript).
 - Updated multiple dependencies and dev dependencies (@types/node, axios, core-js, events, sinon, tape and the babel cli, core, preset-env, register and plugin-transform-runtime)

10.9.2 (Nov 20, 2019)
 - Bugfixing - When using Redis, return expire result to avoid race condition with redis disconnection due to a client destroy.
 - Sonar - Removed extra parameter from function invocation to remove the only bug highlighted by Sonar.

10.9.1 (Nov 7, 2019)
 - Bugfixing - Avoid certain keys (containing one of three keywords) on the browser to generate a request to the wrong endpoint.
 - Added SonarQube integration.

10.9.0 (Oct 24, 2019)
 - Added listener for 'unload' DOM events to push remaining impressions and events when the browser page is closed or reloaded.
 - Added setting core.IPAddressesEnabled to disable reporting IP Addresses and Machine name back to Split cloud.
 - Updated Redis storage to fetch multiple splits at once for getTreatments/getTreatmentsWithConfig.
 - Updated most dependencies to their latest versions. Biggest change is babel (from 6 to 7), Webpack 3 to 4, Karma and ioredis.

10.8.4 (Sep 24, 2019)
 - Added module "events" as optional dependency.
 - Removed dependency on "util" module.
 - Updated transport module to use a local axios instance instead of the global one, to avoid polluting the shared one.
 - Updated input validation log when trying to get data of a non-existent split to have level WARN instead of ERROR.

10.8.3 (Sep 16, 2019)
 - Updated two default values on startup configuration for Browsers:
   - startup.readyTimeout default value went up from 1.5s to 10s.
   - startup.retriesOnFailureBeforeReady default value went up from 1.5s to 5s.
 - Updated trafficType from manager to 'localhost' when the SDK is running in localhost mode.
 - Updated polling logic to stop and restart mySegments data synchronization (on browsers) when not currently used on Splits.

10.8.2 (Jul 26, 2019)
 - Added `/src` folder to the npm package distribution for users that needs to transpile the package themselves.
 - Bugfixing - Incorrect warnings caused by TrafficType storage counter when a Split is updated for inMemory and LocalStorage mode.
 - Updated three dev dependencies to remove vulnerability warnings when running npm audit (lodash, set-value, mixin-deep).

10.8.1 (May 31, 2019)
 - Updated axios version to 0.19.0 to remove a DoS vulnerability (not affecting the SDK but worth updating).

10.8.0 (May 23, 2019)
 - Added support for optional event properties via our client.track() method. Read more in our docs!

10.7.2 (May 15, 2019)
 - Bugfixing - Fixing ES6 import syntax for LabelConstants module.

10.7.1 (May 10, 2019)
 - Added Block Until Ready functionality support for consumer clients (Redis mode on Node) to make integration code work the same between modes.
 - Added more Input and Usage Validation rules, including an extra label for impressions when the SDK is not ready.
 - Updated the SDK Redis adapter to handle pending commands when disconnecting from the Redis server.
 - Bugfixing - Clearing up readyTimeout after we don't need it anymore. It also fixes the missleading SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT error log when using Redis.

10.7.0 (Apr 30, 2019)
 - Added Block Until Ready functionality to the manager, shared with the main client. Now you can subscribe to SDK events or use the .ready() promise from the manager as well.
 - Added Dynamic Configurations support through two new methods that mimick the regular ones, changing the type of what is returned.
   - getTreatmentWithConfig: Same as getTreatment, but instead of a string it returns a map with treatment and config as a stringified JSON.
   - getTreatmentWithConfig: Same as getTreatments, but instead of a map of string it returns a map of objects with treatment and config as a stringified JSON.
 - Added configs to SplitViews returned by the manager module.
 - Updated localhost mode. Now besides supporting the old text files with `.split` extension (to be deprecated soon), we support YAML (.yaml/.yml) files where you can
  define configurations for your treatments and also whitelisted keys. Read more in our docs!
 - Updated manager method to avoid creating more than one instance.
 - Updated how we handle timeout per request, setting startup.requestTimeoutBeforeReady to less than 1 applies no timeout per request.

10.6.1 (Mar 15, 2019)
 - Updated default value for scheduler.featuresRefreshRate on NodeJS. New default is 5 seconds.

10.6.0 (Feb 12, 2019)
 - BREAKING CHANGE: Updated impressions cache for Redis storage to reduce the amount of Redis operations by using a single queue (Must use Synchronizer 2.x or above with this or newer SDK versions).
 - Added stricter validations to the input of the SDK api to provide better and faster feedback in case of missuse. We want our users to be able to diagnose issues sooner,
  instead of when you can't find the data you're looking for. As part of this, some error logs (just logs) will be visible even with the SDK Logger disabled.
 - Updated getTreatments to have it's own latency metric for the whole operation, instead of one per each feature evaluation.
 - Updated default values on configuration for NodeJS.
   - startup.readyTimeout default value went up from 0s (no timeout limit) to 15s.
   - startup.retriesOnFailureBeforeReady default value went up from 0 (no retries) to 1.
 - Bugfixing - Preventing "Uncaught in promise (undefined)" error for .ready() promise when no error handlers are attached to it.
 - Bugfixing - Always throw JS errors inside callbacks attached to the SDK, so developers don't miss them.

10.5.1 (Dec 20, 2018)
 - Bugfixing - Fixing an issue where a Split with Traffic Allocation set to one would return the default treatment for 100% of the traffic (instead of 99%).

10.5.0 (Nov 7, 2018)
 - Added custom impression listener feature, so customers can receive all the impressions data on a callback to handle as they place.
  Completely optional, the only requirement is that the element being set as impression listener should have a method called `logImpression`
  where they'll receive all the data. Read more in our docs!
 - Added Redis support for track events. Now if you're running the `split-synchronizer` and the Node SDK on `consumer mode`, your track events
  will go to Redis and be sent to Split by the synchronizer.
 - Added a wrapper on top of ioredis to better handle operations and reduce unwanted library effects.
 - Removed unnecessary keys/scans on Redis.
 - Bugfixing - Calling factory.client on the browser with the same key used on configuration created a new unnecessary instance.
 - Bugfixing - Fixing multiple instances of the client without specific scheduler configurations cause overflow on timeout values.

10.4.0 (Oct 4, 2018)
 - Removed dependency for logging library.
 - Removed dependency on lodash.
 - Added log level support for SDK logs using our own Logger implementation. Now besides just enable/disable,
  you can set the log level as a string (more information on our docs or on Detailed-README.md).
 - Added automatic cleanup and data flush for NodeJS on SIGTERM signals.
 - Updated default value for startup.requestTimeoutBeforeReady on the Browser from 0.8 seconds to 1.5 seconds to match startup.readyTimeout.
 - Updated dependency versions.
 - Bugfixing - Capturing uncaught exception on some http and network errors.
 - Bugfixing - IE - Producer names logged as undefined.

 - TS declarations now accept boolean properties on Attributes.

10.2.0 (April 3, 2018)
 - Added greenkeeper configuration within package.json.
 - Updated several libraries versions.
 - Removed global polyfills.

10.1.1 (March 20, 2018)
 - Bugfixing - getTreatment will return 'control' and the impression registered
  will have label 'exception' when there is a Redis Exception.

10.1.0 (March 8, 2018)
 - Replaced isomorphic-fetch with axios.

10.0.0 (Feb 26, 2018)

 - Added package-lock.json.
 - Fixed eslint configuration.

9.4.0 (Jan 12, 2018)
 - Adding support for client.track method, for tracking custom events.
 - Adding trafficType as an optional core setting. If provided on the browser it will be binded to the client as the key.
 - TypeScript declarations polishing.
 - Updated SDK labels.
 - Bugfixing - Shared clients (browser) were ready even if the main client was not.
 - Bugfixing - Shared clients (browser) from different SDK instances should be separate.
 - Bugfixing - When using API key with wrong permissions, Node was throwing a false ready event (without segments).
 - Bugfixing - Localhost mode was trying to flush impressions when client.destroy was invoked.

9.3.7 (Dec 22, 2017)
 - Updated SDK labels.

9.3.6 (Oct 12, 2017)
 - Fixed an issue that was not rejecting client.ready() on SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT event.
 - Fixed an issue where the SDK required a key even on localhost mode.

9.2.2 (Jul 20, 2017)
 - Bugfixing - Added support into the SDK to flush impressions before destroy the instance.

9.2.1 (May 19, 2017)
 - Bugfixing - Issue with dependency that exposes untranspiled code through cjs require, causes
  problems on IE and Node 3.

9.2.0 (May 11, 2017)
 - Dropped migration build. Migration packages will no longer receive updates.
 - Updated logging functionality. SDK will handle logging with a minimalistic enable/disable approach.
  Now you have three ways to enable/disable SDK logging:

  1. By setting the localStorage.splitio_debug (browser) or SPLITIO_DEBUG environment var (node)
    with 'on', 'enable' or 'enabled'.

  2. By passing an extra setting when instantiating the SDK.

    ```js
    var splitio = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');

    var settings = {
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
        key: 'CUSTOMER_KEY'  // If on the browser.
      },
      debug: true  // Boolean flag for enabling logs. Default value is false.
    };

    var sdk = splitio(settings);
    ```

  3. By calling the SDK Logger API (no need for browser refresh):

    ```js
    var splitio = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');

    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
        key: 'CUSTOMER_KEY'  // If on the browser.
      }
    });

    // Logger API.
    sdk.Logger.enable();
    sdk.Logger.disable();
    ```

 - Added Time Tracker logs. When logs are enabled, we log how much time takes to complete
  SDK important tasks, like getting ready, downloading important information or pushing
  metrics and impressions to Split.
 - Bugfixing - Return correct label when consulted Split is not found.

9.1.1 (May 03, 2017)
 - Bugfixing - Fixed invalid behaviour when using native Fetch API and comparing statusText
  instead of resp.ok

9.1.0 (April 21, 2017)
 - Adding support for STRING matchers.
 - client.destroy() will disconnect from Redis instance, if you are using that storage.
 - Improved support for multiple SDK instances working at the same time.
 - Improved attribute values type coercion.
 - No API changes.

9.0.0 (April 17, 2017)
 - Adding support for SET matchers.
 - Added some type coercion for attribute values, in case we don't receive a value of the expected type.
 - No API changes.

8.2.0 (April 12, 2017)
 - Adding traffic allocation support.
 - Adding support for murmur hashing algorithm.
 - Adding getTreatments method to client API. For example:

```js
var treatmentsMap = client.getTreatments('CUSTOMER_KEY', ['Split_1', 'Split_2']);

/*
* treatmentsMap will be an object mapping splits with treatments. For example:
* {
*   Split_1: 'on',
*   Split_2: 'off
* }
*/
```

 - Bugfixing on manager API for localhost.

8.1.3 (April 11, 2017)
 - No API changes. Bug fixing release.

8.1.2 (April 6, 2017)
 - Bug fixing release to improve startup performance.

8.1.1 (March 31, 2017)
 - Small fix on declaration files.

8.1.0 (March 30, 2017)
 - No API changes.
 - Added typescript support. SplitSDK custom types live on the SplitIO namespace.

  For example:

  ```ts
  const myTreatment: SplitIO.Treatment;
  const myBrowserSettings: SplitIO.IBrowserSettings;
  ```

8.0.0 (March 10, 2017)
 - New API to improve development experience. We added a migration layer so you
  could use the new version of the SDK and make the migration when you have
  time.

  In the browser we only need:

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-7.4.0.min.js"></script>
  ```

  Change by:

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-migration-8.0.0.min.js"></script>
  ```

  In NodeJS or CommonJS environments:

  ```js
  var sdk = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');
  ```

  Change with:

  ```js
  var sdk = require('@splitsoftware/splitio/migration');
  ```

 - NodeJS now added support for Redis to keep consistency across multiple SDK
  instances.

  We have added a new setting parameter to control which storage use, and how
  the SDK works internally:

  ```js
  const SplitFactory = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');
  const config = {
    mode: 'consumer',
    core: {
      authorizationKey: '<your-api-token>'
    },
    storage: {
      type: 'REDIS',
      options: {
        url: 'redis://<your-redis-server>:<your-redis-server-port>/0'
      },
      prefix: 'nodejs' // Optional prefix to prevent any kind of data collision between SDK versions.
    }
  };

  const client = SplitFactory(config);

  // Redis in NodeJS is async so we can use async/await syntax
  const treatment = await client.getTreatment('my-feature-comming-from-localstorage');

  // or just use the returned promise
  client.getTreatment('my-feature-comming-from-localstorage').then(treatment => {
    // do something with the treatment
  });
  ```

 - Added Manager API to query the state of the SDK. Please check the official
  documenation for details.

 - In Browser land, we can now enable localStorage as backend so we can reload
  the SDK quickly without downloading all the data again.

  This should improve the ready event significantly when you have a good amount
  of Splits in your setup.

  ```js
  const config = {
    core: {
      authorizationKey: '<your-api-token>',
      key: '<user-key>'
    },
    storage: {
      type: 'LOCALSTORAGE'
    }
  };

  const factory = splitio(config);
  const client = factory.client();

  const treatment = client.getTreatment('my-feature-comming-from-localstorage');
  ```

 - Added support for offline changes release to improve development experience,
  specially in NodeJS where we used to have a server running and spin it up each
  time we change a treatment is a headache.

  ```js
  const config = {
    core: {
      authorizationKey: '<your-api-token>',
      key: '<user-key>'
    },
    scheduler: {
      offlineRefreshRate: 15 // update internal SDK state each 15 sec
    },
    features: {
      mySplit: 'on'
    }
  };

  const factory = splitio(config);
  const client = factory.client();

  await client.ready();

  client.getTreatment('my_feature') === 'on'; // true

  factory.settings.features.my_feature = 'off'; // Apply this cache programatically

  client.getTreatment('my_feature') === 'off'; // Some time after you will be able to verify this
  ```

7.4.0 (January 23, 2017)
 - None API changes. Bug fixing release.

7.3.0 (January 19, 2017)
 - Small addition to SDK configurations so you can inject bucketing key and labels.

7.1.1 (November 16, 2016)

6.0.1 (June 24, 2016)
 - Critical bug fixed which prevent ready state of the SDK.

6.0.0 (June 24, 2016)
 - In the browser land we allow quick retries before start using the refresh
  rates defined for segments and splits, plus the possibility of receive an
  event when the SDK is taking to much time to startup.

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-6.0.0.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
        key: 'myuser@domain.com'
      },
      startup: {
        // timeout an *initial* request after 0.8 seconds (only affects startup)
        requestTimeoutBeforeReady: 0.8,
        // how many quick retries are allowed before use the schedulers refresh
        // rates (only affects startup)
        retriesOnFailureBeforeReady: 1,
        // maximum amount of seconds we are going to wait for the ready event
        readyTimeout: 1.5
      }
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT, function () {
      // this callback will be called after 1.5 seconds if and only if the SDK
      // is not ready for that time
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_READY, function () {
      // the SDK is ready for start making evaluations with your data
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_UPDATE, function () {
      // fired each time the SDK state change
    });
  </script>
  ```

5.1.1 (June 13, 2016)
 - None API changes. Bug fixing release.

5.1.0 (June 9, 2016)
 - Bug fixing release.

5.0.0 (June 6, 2016)
 - Added support for multiple instances.

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-5.0.0.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    // instanciation
    var dynamic1 = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
        key: 'myuser@domain.com'
      }
    });

    var dynamic2 = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
        key: 'annoy@domain.com'
      }
    });

    // usage
    var t1 = dynamic1.getTreatment('split-name');
    var t2 = dynamic2.getTreatment('another-split-name');

    // stop SDK
    dynamic1.destroy();
    dynamic2.destroy();

    // unreference
    dynamic1 = null;
    dynamic2 = null;
  </script>
  ```

 - SDK instances inherit from EventEmitter.

  ```html
  <script src="//cdn.split.io/sdk/split-5.0.0.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
        key: 'myuser@domain.com'
      }
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_READY, function sdkReadyEvent() {
      // This event will be fired once
    });

    sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_UPDATE, function sdkUpdateEvent() {
      // This event will be fired each time the SDK downloads an update
    });
  </script>
  ```

4.0.0 (April 13, 2016)
 - No more url changes required to switch to development mode.

  - Before (3.0.0 or earlier)
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.split.io/sdk/offline-3.0.0.js"></script>
  <script>
    var sdk = splitio({
      features: {
        feature_name_1: 'treatment_value_1',
        feature_name_2: 'treatment_value_2',
        ...
      }
    });
  </script>
  ```

  - After (4+)
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.split.io/sdk/split-4.0.0.js"></script>
  <script>
    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'localhost'
      },
      features: {
        feature_name_1: 'treatment_value_1',
        feature_name_2: 'treatment_value_2',
        ...
      }
    });
  </script>
  ```

  Now you can forget the switch between urls, everything is bundled into the same
  package!

3.0.0 (April 10, 2016)
 - Added support for attributes.

```js
var sdk = splitio({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'c1l5vkd50gimccout3c03pntbu', // your API key
    key: '4a2c4490-ced1-11e5-9b97-d8a25e8b1578'     // your customer id
  }
});

var treatment = sdk.getTreatment('my_feature', {
  age: 24,
  likes: ['apple', 'orange'],
  dob: new Date('1991-05-22').getTime()
});
```

 - Minor bug fixes and code clean up.

2.1.0 (March 29, 2016)
 - Added better handling of possible error situations when:

  1. If there is none defaultTreatment present, use 'control' treatment.
  2. Unexpected matcher structures should produce a 'control' treatment.

2.0.0 (March 21, 2016)
 - Breaking Changes

  - If you are using custom refresh rates, please change them from milliseconds to
seconds:

```js
var sdk = splitio({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'c1l5vkd50gimccout3c03pntbu', // your API key
    key: '4a2c4490-ced1-11e5-9b97-d8a25e8b1578'     // your customer id
  },
  scheduler: {
    featuresRefreshRate:    60, // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 60000 milliseconds
    segmentsRefreshRate:    60, // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 60000 milliseconds
    metricsRefreshRate:     30, // in 2.x 30 sec, in 1.x 30000 milliseconds
    impressionsRefreshRate: 30  // in 2.x 30 sec, in 1.x 30000 milliseconds
  }
});
```

 - New features

  - Based on users feedback, the new recommended values for all the refresh rates are:

```js
scheduler: {
  featuresRefreshRate:    30, // in 2.x 30 sec, in 1.x 60000 milliseconds (1min)
  segmentsRefreshRate:    60, // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 60000 milliseconds (1min)
  metricsRefreshRate:     60, // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 300000 milliseconds (5min)
  impressionsRefreshRate: 60  // in 2.x 60 sec, in 1.x 300000 milliseconds (5min)
}
```

1.0.1 (March 16, 2016)
