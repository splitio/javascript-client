## 9.2.0 (XX XX, 2017)

* Dropped migration build. Migration packages will no longer receive updates.
* Updated logging functionality. SDK will handle logging with a minimalistic enable/disable approach.
  Now you have three ways to enable/disable SDK logging:

  1. By setting the localStorage.splitio_debug (browser) or SPLITIO_DEBUG environment var (node)
    with 'on', 'enable' or 'enabled'.

  2. By passing an extra setting when instantiating the SDK.

    ```js
    var splitio = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');

    var settings = {
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
        key: 'CUSTOMER_KEY'  // If on the browser.
      },
      debug: true  // Boolean flag for enabling logs. Default value is false.
    };

    var sdk = splitio(settings);
    ```

  3. By calling the SDK Logger API (no need for browser refresh):

    ```js
    var splitio = require('@splitsoftware/splitio');

    var sdk = splitio({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
        key: 'CUSTOMER_KEY'  // If on the browser.
      }
    });

    // Logger API.
    sdk.Logger.enable();
    sdk.Logger.disable();
    ```

## 9.1.1 (May 03, 2017)

* Bugfixing - Fixed invalid behaviour when using native Fetch API and comparing statusText
  instead of resp.ok

## 9.1.0 (April 21, 2017)

* Adding support for STRING matchers.

## 9.0.0 (April 17, 2017)

* Adding support for SET matchers.

## 8.2.0 (April 12, 2017)

* Added Traffic Allocation support. You can specify how much of your traffic you
  want to send to the rollout plan of a Split via Split Editor.

* Added support for murmur hashing algorithm for better bucket calculations.

* Adding getTreatments method to client API. For example:

```js
var treatmentsMap = client.getTreatments('CUSTOMER_KEY', ['Split_1', 'Split_2']);

/*
* treatmentsMap will be an object mapping splits with treatments. For example:
* {
*   Split_1: 'on',
*   Split_2: 'off
* }
*/
```

## 8.1.0 (March 30, 2017)

Added typescript support. SplitSDK custom types live on the SplitIO namespace.

For example:

```ts
const myTreatment: SplitIO.Treatment;
const myBrowserSettings: SplitIO.IBrowserSettings;
```

## 8.0.0 (March 10, 2017)

* New API to improve development experience. We added a migration layer so you
  could use the new version of the SDK and make the migration when you have
  time.

* NodeJS now added support for Redis to keep consistency across multiple SDK
  instances.

* Added Manager API to query the state of the SDK.

* In Browser land, we can now enable localStorage as backend so we can reload
  the SDK quickly without downloading all the data again.

* Added support for offline changes release to improve development experience,
  specially in NodeJS where we used to have a server running and spin it up each
  time we change a treatment is a headache.

## 7.4.0 (January 23, 2017)

Exposed internal event SDK_SPLITS_ARRIVED to allow customers to monitor partial
readiness of the SDK.

## 7.3.0 (January 19, 2017)

### Added bucketing key support

Sometimes you want to have annonymous users but been able to track them as
users after a authentication process. Having this in mind, we provide a way to
generate treatments using a fixed key (bucketing key), while been able to change
the matching key without problem, so you can garantice a consistent experience
without been worried about the matching key.

```
var sdk = splitio({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: '<your-token>',
    key: {
      matchingKey: '<your-usual-key>',
      bucketingKey: '<a-new-key-for-calculate-the-treatment>'
    }
  }
});
```

### Added labels support

In order to improve visibility in what is happening while doing a matching, we
are collecting by default some extra information while doing a getTreatment
call. The information includes:

1. Which condition has been matched?
2. Which SDK language & version has generated the impression?
3. If you are running NodeJS, we are adding machine name and ip so you could
   track evaluations in a cluster.

## 7.1.1 (November 16, 2016)

* In some particular combinations of NodeJS / OS the
  `require('@splitsoftware/splitio')` could fail. Added a workaround to fix the
  problem.

## 7.1.0 (November 15, 2016)

* Bug fixing release. Reported an error with ember-browserify due to an
  incorrect reference to the core files.
* Development dependencies updated to latest. No breaking changes during the
  migration.

## 7.0.1 (September 16, 2016)

* Added missing support for UMD.
* Added more information in the README for easily installation.

## 6.0.1 (June 24, 2016)

* Critical bug fixed which prevent ready state of the SDK.

## 6.0.0 (June 24, 2016)

* In the browser land, it's important to have quick retries before after a
  stretch timeouts. We added new configurations to handle this.
* Added the concept of 'ready timeout', so you could take a controlled action if
  the SDK is taking too much time doing the startup.
* Fixed few bugs, specially for the browser release.
* `.ready()` method is deprecated in favor of
  `sdk.on(sdk.Event.SDK_READY, function onReady() { do something; })`

## 5.1.1 (June 13, 2016)

* Added missing support for events in offline mode (NodeJS and Browser).

## 5.1.0 (June 9, 2016)

* Bug fixing release.

## 5.0.0 (June 6, 2016)

* Added support for multiple instances. Now we can call the SDK factory multiple
  times.
* SDK instances inherit from EventEmitter. For now we only notifies state changes
  so you could ask the instance to evaluates `getTreatment` to reflect changes
  in your system.

## 4.0.0 (April 13, 2016)

* Refactored offline mode. No more url changes required to switch to development
  mode.

## 3.0.0 (April 10, 2016)

## 2.1.0 (March 29, 2016)

* Internal improvements. It's safe to upgrade without making code changes.

## 2.0.0 (March 21, 2016)

  are in *seconds* instead of *milliseconds*.
