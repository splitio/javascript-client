# Split SDK for JavaScript

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40splitsoftware%2Fsplitio.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40splitsoftware%2Fsplitio) [![Build Status](https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/splitio/javascript-client.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## Overview
This SDK is designed to work with Split, the platform for controlled rollouts, which serves features to your users via feature flags to manage your complete customer experience.

## Compatibility
The JavaScript SDK is an isomorphic library for both Node.js and Web browser environments.

It supports **Node.js version 6.x and npm 3.x or later**.

For browsers it supports **IE10+ and all the other major browsers**. *However, IE doesn't have native support for Promises, which we require to properly work. If you're targeting IE it's up to you to provide Promises support. You should include a polyfill like [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise).*

## Getting started
Below is a simple Node.js example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:
```javascript
// Import the SDK
var SplitFactory = require('@splitsoftware/splitio').SplitFactory;

// Instantiate the SDK
var factory = SplitFactory({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY'
  }
});

// Get the client instance you'll use
var client = factory.client();

// Set a callback to listen for the SDK_READY event, to make sure the SDK is properly loaded before asking for a treatment
client.on(client.Event.SDK_READY, function() {
  var treatment = client.getTreatment('CUSTOMER_ID', 'FEATURE_FLAG_NAME');
  if (treatment == 'on') {
    // insert code here for on treatment
  } else if (treatment == 'off') {
    // insert code here for off treatment
  } else {
    // insert your control treatment code here
  }
});
```
