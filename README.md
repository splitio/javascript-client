### Commitment to Quality:

Split’s SDKs are in active development and are constantly tested for quality. Unit tests are developed for each SDK based on the unique needs of that language, and integration tests, load and performance tests, and behavior consistency tests are running 24/7 via automated bots. In addition, monitoring instrumentation ensures that these SDKs behave under the expected parameters of memory, CPU, and I/O.
